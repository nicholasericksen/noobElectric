## Background
This experiment utilized a red filter in front of an unpolarized source of approx. 9% polarization.
Optical formulas that deal with polarizationv, such as the Stokes parameters, rely on the monochromatic nature of the light source.v
Lasers have proven beneficial for providing a nearly idealized light source.  The laser was developed in [year] and provided a unique source of monochromatic and coherent light [1].
This experiment focuses on using an unpolarized lamp for the purpose of simulating the outdoor environment on overcast days [2]

A red filter was used due to the wavelength dependancy of the quarter wave plate.  Red light from a helium neon laser fires at 632.8 nm.  A red filter in front of an unpolarized light was
used to reduce the achromatic nature of the source.

This will prove more ideal in the case of observing diattenuation and using the polarization filters in the role of the generator arm in the classical LMP.

This leaf type is an outdoor variety that contains a thin wax membrane.  The leaf was one week removed from the plant.

## Conclusion
The results show...v

1 [polarized light reference]
2 v[scatted light by vegetation referencev]
