## Background
This introductory experiment was a first glimpse into how the surface of a leaf
effects the polarization states that result from an incident unpolarized light source.

Plastic linear polarizers were used to obtain the discrete flux measurements needed to
calculate the S1 and S2 parameters of the Stokes vector.

These components represent the degree of linear polarization that results from the reflection of light off of a leafs' surface.  It is the m10 and m20 elements of the Mueller Matrix respectively.  The first column of the Mueller Matrix is known as the Polarizance vector.  It is the exiting Stokes vector when unpolarized light is incident.

A wet leaf is one that is freshly removed from the plant.  A dry leaf is one that is 1 week old.

## Conclusion
As surface roughness increases so does the amount of randomized scattering.  The specular reflections off of the leaf surface are highly polarized, especially at the Brewster angle of the two surfaces. As the surface roughness increases, the amount of specular reflection decreases. More diffuse scattering occurs and is characterized as being unpolarized.  The diffuse scattering increases, and as a result so does the randomized polarization states that result from the incident light.

The increased in unpolarized light represents a decrease in the radius of the Poincare sphere.  The inner sphere contains information related to the polarization of the specular reflection.  The diffuse portion represents the result of the Poincare sphere being subtracted from a unity sphere, where unity represents a fully polarized wave with DOP = 1.  Further measurements are required, namely the circular components, in order to fully draw the Stokes vector in 3D space on the Poincare sphere.

Although some have speculated that little information can be gained from the S3 component of the light, its importance is evident when displayed in 3D vector space.
