This is a package for Electrical Engineering principals.
It is designed for aiding study, as well as practical application.  

### Topics Covered
* Mueller Matrices

### Background
There are scientific computing packages for a wide variety of applications in Python,
but none that attempt to host topics specifically related to Electrical Engineering.
This package will attempt to cover most topics found during one's study at a university.
Hopefully there are some practical applications as well.
